# pyGUIme

Pyguime is a simple GUI framework for pygame.

The framework produces simple graphics, that are suitable
for use on little Raspberry Pi touchscreens, and
similar devices.

It is not intended to be a fully fledged GUI replacement, but it
also isn't as complicated to use as some other packages.
